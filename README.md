MY BEHAVIOR, PERHAPS, EGREGIOUS, UNDERHAND,
UNFORGIVABLE MY SPEECH THAT WALKED
DISEMBODIED FROM THE VULNERABLE
NASCENT BLISS IN THE WILDERNESS
YOU HELD OUT TO ME
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.
EMANATE
YOUR PRESENCE,
AND LET ME STRIVE
IN THE INDIGO SHADOWS FOR YOUR TOLERANCE.


WHEN FOG ROLLS IN, CLOUDS UNFOLD
YOUR SELFLESS WINGS’ FEATHERS
THAT FLOAT FROM ARABESQUE PILLOWS I SOLD
TO BE CONSUMED BY THE SNOW WHITE COLD.
IF ONLY THE PLASTER COULD HOLD, WITHSTAND
THE FLAME, THEN THIS FOUNTAIN TORCH
WOULD KNOW NO SHAME AND BE OUTSTRIPPED
ONLY BY THE SUN THAT BURNS WITH THE GLORY
AND HONOR OF YOUR IMMORTA
