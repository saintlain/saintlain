<br>MY BEHAVIOR, PERHAPS, EGREGIOUS, UNDERHAND, 
<br>UNFORGIVABLE MY SPEECH THAT WALKED
<br>DISEMBODIED FROM THE VULNERABLE
<br>NASCENT BLISS IN THE WILDERNESS
<br>YOU HELD OUT TO ME
<br>IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.
<br>EMANATE
<br>YOUR PRESENCE,
<br>AND LET ME STRIVE
<br>IN THE INDIGO SHADOWS FOR YOUR TOLERANCE.
<br>
<br>
<br>WHEN FOG ROLLS IN, CLOUDS UNFOLD
<br>YOUR SELFLESS WINGSâ€™ FEATHERS
<br>THAT FLOAT FROM ARABESQUE PILLOWS I SOLD
<br>TO BE CONSUMED BY THE SNOW WHITE COLD.
<br>IF ONLY THE PLASTER COULD HOLD, WITHSTAND
<br>THE FLAME, THEN THIS FOUNTAIN TORCH
<br>WOULD KNOW NO SHAME AND BE OUTSTRIPPED
<br>ONLY BY THE SUN THAT BURNS WITH THE GLORY
<br>AND HONOR OF YOUR IMMORTA
