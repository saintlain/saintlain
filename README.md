MY BEHAVIOR, PERHAPS, EGREGIOUS, UNDERHAND,

UNFORGIVABLE MY SPEECH THAT WALKED

DISEMBODIED FROM THE VULNERABLE

NASCENT BLISS IN THE WILDERNESS

YOU HELD OUT TO ME

IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND.

EMANATE

YOUR PRESENCE,

AND LET ME STRIVE

IN THE INDIGO SHADOWS FOR YOUR TOLERANCE.



WHEN FOG ROLLS IN, CLOUDS UNFOLD

YOUR SELFLESS WINGS’ FEATHERS

THAT FLOAT FROM ARABESQUE PILLOWS I SOLD

TO BE CONSUMED BY THE SNOW WHITE COLD.

IF ONLY THE PLASTER COULD HOLD, WITHSTAND

THE FLAME, THEN THIS FOUNTAIN TORCH

WOULD KNOW NO SHAME AND BE OUTSTRIPPED

ONLY BY THE SUN THAT BURNS WITH THE GLORY

AND HONOR OF YOUR IMMORTA
